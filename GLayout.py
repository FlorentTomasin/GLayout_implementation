The network is modeled as a 2D square grid.
The network is confined within an area, L.

The particles (nodes) interact according to a predefined energy 
function based on the network topological structure. 
A configuration of the particles represents a layout of the network, 
where all edges are straight lines. 
The energy of a configuration is the cost score of the corresponding
layout. 
A stable configuration has low energy; equivalently, an acceptable 
layout has a low cost score.

->vector of coordinates:
        R = (r1, r2, ..., rn), where n is the number of nodes
        and ri = (xi, yi) the coordinates of a node i.
        All nodes are on grid points. and xi, yi are intergers

        Layout of a network is defined by the cost function:
                costFunction(R, i, j): sum cost betwen all pairs of 
                the node.
                costBetweenNode(R, i, j): wij * d(ri, rj)
                    wij is the cost weight between nodes ij
                    d the distance between nodes ij
                    d(ri, rj) = | xi - xj | + | yi - yj |
