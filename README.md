# GLayout_implementation
The GLayout implementation is a tool to display nodes graph.
It is based on research papers named "A grid layout algorithm for automatic drawing of biochemical networks." from Department of Bioscience and Bioinformatics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan, 2005.

The idea is to determine nodes and edges position in the graph by using attraction and repulsion forces applied on nodes.
An edge will be associated to a weight.
